# VibeSound

People often listen to music to express their feelings and regulate their emotions. But choosing the right music from the extensive options available that resonates with oneâ€™s current mood is a dull and daunting task. It is challenging because users must scroll through the endless playlists on the music streaming applications to find the right music on their own based on their mood. Our goal is to develop a Mood-Based Music Recommender that utilizes existing technologies like facial analysis and emoji-based questionnaire in a way that makes it fun and engaging for the users and enhance their overall experience when searching for music to listen to on their favorite music streaming applications.
